# Recycling Page
Phase 3 (needs inventory import);
Material Shortage Planner
Purpose: Help users figure out how to obtain materials they need by analyzing their inventory and suggesting optimal recycling strategies.
Description: Users input the materials they need (e.g., "20x metal_parts, 5x chemicals") and select items from their inventory. The system analyzes all possible recycling combinations and recommends the optimal strategy - which items to recycle and in what quantities to best meet their needs. It shows what materials will be obtained, what's still missing (shortfall), and provides actionable suggestions like "Find 7x arc_alloy" or "Check vendors for metal_parts." Multiple alternative strategies are also shown, optimized for different criteria (minimum value loss, fewest steps, or maximum coverage of requirements).
